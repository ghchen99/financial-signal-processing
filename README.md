# Financial Signal Processing 

This repository contains the coursework assignments for the Financial Signal Processing course taught by Prof. Danilo P. Mandic. The coursework covers various topics related to financial data analysis and modeling. The assignments are designed to enhance your understanding of regression methods, bond pricing, portfolio optimization, robust statistics, non-linear methods, and graphs in finance.

## 1. Regression Methods
## 1.1 Processing stock price data in Python
In this task, the "priceData.csv" dataset will be used to perform various operations using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The dataset contains stock price data that will be transformed and analyzed.

## 1.2 ARMA vs. ARIMA Models for Financial Applications
In this task, the "snp_500_2015_2019.csv" dataset will be used. It contains closing prices of the S&P 500 index over the last four years. The dataset will be preprocessed and analyzed to determine the suitability of ARMA and ARIMA models for financial applications.

## 1.3 Vector Autoregressive (VAR) Models
In this task, the "snp_allstocks_2015_2019.csv" dataset will be used. It contains daily closing prices of all the stocks in the S&P 500 index from January 1st, 2015 to January 1st, 2019. Additionally, the "snp_info.csv" dataset provides information related to each stock. The VAR(1) model will be applied to the selected stocks to compute the eigenvalues of the regression matrix A.

## 2. Bond Pricing
This section focuses on bond pricing. Specific examples of bond pricing, forward rates, duration of coupon-bearing bonds, and the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) will be covered.

## 3. Portfolio Optimization
The topic of portfolio optimization will be explored in this section. The focus will be on adaptive minimum-variance portfolio optimization.

## 4. Robust Statistics and Non Linear Methods
This section covers robust statistics and non-linear methods. It includes tasks such as data import and exploratory data analysis, robust estimators, robust and ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, and robust trading strategies.

## 5. Graphs in Finance
The final section focuses on graphs in finance. The use of graphs to represent financial data and perform analysis will be explored.
